**P**ython **P**arametric **OP**timization **T**oolbox (**PPOPT**) is a software platform for solving and manipulating
multiparametric programs in Python. 

## Installation

Currently, PPOPT requires Python 3.8 or higher and can be installed with the following commands.

```bash
pip install ppopt
```

To install PPOPT and install all optional solvers the following installation is recommended. 

```bash 
pip install ppopt[optional]
```

In Python 3.11 and beyond there is currently an error with the quadprog package. An alternate version that fixed this error can be installed here.

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/HKaras/quadprog/
```

## Completed Features

- Solver interface for mpLPs and mpQPs with the following algorithms
    1. Serial and Parallel Combinatorial Algorithms
    2. Serial and Parallel Geometrical Algorithms
    3. Serial and Parallel Graph based Algorithms
- Solver interface for mpMILPs and mpMIQPs with the following algorithms
    1. Enumeration based algorithm

applications, [this paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fceng.2020.620168/full) is a good jumping point.

## Quick Overview

To give a fast primer of what we are doing, we are solving multiparametric programming problems (fast) by writing
parallel algorithms efficiently. Here is a quick scaling analysis on a large multiparametric program with the
combinatorial algorithm.

Here is a benchmark against the state of the art multiparametric programming solvers. All tests run on the Terra
Supercomputer at Texas A&M University. Matlab 2021b was used for solvers written in matlab and Python 3.8 was used for
PPOPT.
